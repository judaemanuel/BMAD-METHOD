`bmad-project-context` sets up a repository so AI agents work well in it. The output is a small verified block inside the repo's `AGENTS.md`: what the org requires, the commands unaided agents get wrong, the conventions where the obvious guess is wrong, and the mistakes agents keep making here.

It is a conversation, not a generator. You bring the rules you want followed — governance, security, coding standards — and it discovers and verifies the rest. The human is in the loop for every write; there is no unattended mode.

For the full reasoning, including what is deliberately *not* captured and why, see [The Theory of Project Context](project-context-theory.md).

## What goes in, and what doesn't

The governing line is whether a fact can be derived by reading the repository. Agents read code more accurately than they read prose describing code, and a stored description is a stale duplicate charged on every call. The evidence-based exception is a command that unaided session history shows agents get wrong despite the repository stating it. So repo overviews, directory trees and tech-stack lists never enter.

What earns a line is what the code cannot say:

- **Policy** the org requires — frozen paths, generated files, branch rules, security and compliance.
- **Commands unaided agents get wrong**, admitted from session history. Commands agents consistently get right stay in their source of truth; aided success alone never proves an admitted instruction became unnecessary.
- **What a config file cannot say about running the project** — `pnpm test` may be in `package.json`, but that the suite takes eleven minutes or needs a service running first is not.
- **Conventions that differ from ecosystem defaults**, because an agent follows the norm unless told otherwise.
- **Known pitfalls**, admitted only from observed failure — a lesson already recorded, the maintainer's recollection, a mistake fixed repeatedly in git history, or one the writing session made and caught. A trap-looking fact from a scan becomes a question, never a line.
- **Pointers** to where work lands, and to nested or linked files worth reading first.

Every rule the skill applies is written out in `references/best-practices.md`, with the evidence behind it. The skill uses it to assess what your repo already has, and explains its reasoning back to you at the end.

## Four intents

| Intent | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Setup** | The default. Assess what exists, ask what you bring, discover and verify the rest, show you the block, then write it. |
| **Refresh** | The same run against an existing block: re-check its commands and caveats, diff deletions and renames since the recorded commit, update what moved. |
| **Record** | Capture one observed agent mistake at the moment it happens. A recurring or costly one earns a line. |
| **Audit** | Re-verify and prune. The block ends smaller or equal, never larger. |

## How agents load it

`AGENTS.md` at the repo root, which every major coding harness reads. BMad owns only the region between `<!-- bmad:context -->` and `<!-- /bmad:context -->`; everything you write outside those markers is preserved byte for byte, and a refresh never touches it.

Monorepo components and nested repositories get their own file under the same rules, listed as pointers in the parent. A large rule set bounded to a directory belongs in a nested `AGENTS.md` there, where the harness attaches it by location.

## Repo or home directory

What this skill writes belongs committed to the repository — shared by the team, consistent across machines, versioned with the code it constrains. If you find the same rules repeating across every project, or they are your personal preferences rather than the team's, they belong in your agent's global configuration in your home directory instead.

## Interaction with architecture

Decisions are *born* in `bmad-architecture`. If a genuinely contested design decision surfaces here — real tradeoffs, multiple viable shapes — the skill says it deserves `bmad-architecture` rather than quietly making the call.

## Replaces two earlier skills

:::note[Deprecated: bmad-document-project and bmad-generate-project-context]
Both earlier skills are deprecated and now forward here. `bmad-generate-project-context` produced a single `project-context.md` — if you have one, setup offers to absorb its content rather than orphaning it. `bmad-document-project` scanned a brownfield repo into generated documentation, which is the approach the evidence went against; the deeper "explain this system and its rationale" material is a different altitude and is coming as its own capability.
